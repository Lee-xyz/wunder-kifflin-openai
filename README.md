### Introduction
This project allows a conversational retrieval chain using the LangChain framework to allow LLM, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, to excel at answering user made questions with new information by inputting custom text documents and other written data files that is typically not seen in pre-trained datasets. This is achieved by using vector embeddings to allow semantic search over such new documents that is chain-fed into LLMs to refine conversational outputs. 

We will be exploring this project in the context of a fictious e-commerce company named "Wunder Kifflin Inc." as an example made purely for fun. By law, all companies are required to implement workplace policies to protect the rights and safety of employees as well as to provide wide-depth amount of information about the operations of a company conveyed to its employees.

Such workplace policies will then be stored inside different text files for each different policy in the [work-policies folder](/work-policies/). Inside this directory are 11 unique text documents, where each text document therefore represents a distinct work-place policy. Such documents can then serve as a library of reference text that can be semantically searched by OpenAI's ChatGPT (turbo model GPT-3.5) after it is vector embedded and chunked. ChatGPT will then serve as a 24/7 365 support chatbot agent in the HR department to allow Wunder Kifflin Inc. employees to ask specific questions as enquiries related to paid holidays, work hours, workplace rights, promotion eligibility and etc. 

ChatGPT is then a perfect model for this project due to its rise of recent popularity and usage as an information library and as an effective communicator using native language profiency towards its users. Given that its database cut-off date is from September 2021 as of the time of this writing, the need for a LLM to be trained on a custom dataset is ever more prevalent.

Demonstration of a LLM in a practical commercial setting, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, can then allow the use of automated AI to provide effective communication with the company's employees to assist them on matters where required. As a result, existing workforces can then focus on higher priority tasks to allow workforce scalability for far more productive tasks in normal business operations.
