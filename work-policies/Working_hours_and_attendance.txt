Working Hours and Attendance:
a. Employees are expected to maintain regular working hours as specified in their employment contract.

Wunder Kifflin operates on a set schedule to ensure smooth business operations and client service. Employees are expected to adhere to the working hours specified in their employment contract. This includes arriving on time and being present for the duration of their scheduled work hours, unless otherwise approved by their supervisor.

b. Flexible work arrangements may be considered on a case-by-case basis, subject to supervisor approval and operational requirements.

Wunder Kifflin recognizes the importance of work-life balance and understands that some employees may require flexible work arrangements. Requests for flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting, adjusted work hours, or compressed workweeks, will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Such arrangements are subject to supervisor approval and must align with operational requirements and the employee's job responsibilities.

c. Accurate attendance records must be maintained, and employees should notify their supervisor in advance for any planned absences or tardiness.

Maintaining accurate attendance records is crucial for effective workforce management and payroll processing. Employees are responsible for accurately recording their work hours, including start times, end times, and any breaks or meal periods as per company policy.

In the event of planned absences, such as vacations or personal days, employees are required to notify their supervisor in advance and follow the prescribed procedures for requesting leave. Similarly, if an employee anticipates being late or unable to report to work as scheduled due to unforeseen circumstances, they must notify their supervisor as soon as possible, following the company's established protocols.

By adhering to this policy, employees contribute to a well-functioning and efficient work environment at Wunder Kifflin. Regular attendance and punctuality are essential for maintaining productivity, meeting client expectations, and fostering teamwork among colleagues. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including verbal or written warnings, reduction in benefits, or termination, depending on the frequency and severity of the attendance-related issues.

d. Work from Home (WFH) arrangement may be allowed, subject to permission from the employee's head of department.

Wunder Kifflin acknowledges the benefits and flexibility of remote work arrangements. In certain circumstances, employees may be granted the opportunity to work from home. However, the WFH arrangement is subject to the approval of the employee's head of department. Employees should consult with their supervisor and submit a formal request outlining the reasons for the request, proposed duration, and how they plan to ensure productivity and communication while working remotely.

e. Employees working from home must adhere to the company's policies, procedures, and expectations as if they were working from the office.

While working from home, employees are required to comply with all existing company policies, including those related to code of conduct, ethics, confidentiality, data protection, and use of company resources. Employees should maintain regular communication with their supervisor and colleagues, complete assigned tasks within agreed-upon deadlines, and participate in virtual meetings and collaboration as required.

f. The work from home arrangement may be modified or terminated based on operational requirements or at the discretion of the company.

Wunder Kifflin reserves the right to modify or terminate the work from home arrangement based on operational needs, changes in business priorities, or other circumstances. Any changes to the WFH arrangement will be communicated to employees in a timely manner, and employees will be expected to comply with the new arrangements accordingly.

By incorporating the Work from Home (WFH) arrangement into the policies of Wunder Kifflin, the company acknowledges the importance of flexibility and recognizes the evolving nature of work arrangements. It emphasizes the need for employees to adhere to company policies even while working remotely and ensures that the WFH arrangement is subject to appropriate approvals and can be modified or terminated as required by the company.
