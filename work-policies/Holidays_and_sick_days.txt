Leave Policies:
a. Wunder Kifflin provides a comprehensive leave policy, including paid holidays and sick days.

i. Paid Holidays: Employees are entitled to paid holidays as per the seasonal quarter schedule. Each seasonal quarter, employees will receive up to 30 days of paid holidays. These holidays are granted to employees to allow them to rest, rejuvenate, and spend time with their families and loved ones. The specific holiday schedule will be communicated to employees in advance. Paid holidays will not carry forward to the next seasonal quarter.

ii. Sick Days: Wunder Kifflin acknowledges that employees may occasionally fall ill and require time off to recover. Sick days will be provided to employees in accordance with legal requirements. Sick days beyond the allotted paid holidays will not be paid and will be considered as unpaid time off. Employees must notify their supervisor or the designated HR representative as soon as possible when they are unable to work due to illness. Appropriate documentation may be required, as per company policy, for extended periods of sick leave.

b. The entitlement to paid holidays renews once per year, at the beginning of the annual leave cycle.

The entitlement to paid holidays resets at the beginning of the annual leave cycle. Employees will receive a fresh allocation of paid holidays at the start of the new cycle. The specific dates and duration of the annual leave cycle will be communicated to employees.

c. Employees must follow the prescribed procedures for requesting and obtaining leave, providing appropriate notice and supporting documentation as required.

To avail themselves of paid holidays or sick days, employees must adhere to the company's leave request procedures. This may involve submitting a leave request form, notifying their supervisor in advance, and providing any necessary supporting documentation, such as medical certificates for sick leave. Employees should familiarize themselves with the company's leave request process and comply with the specified timelines for submitting leave requests.

By incorporating the Paid Holidays and Sick Days policy into the existing policies of Wunder Kifflin, the company aims to provide employees with adequate time off for rest, relaxation, and personal well-being. It establishes clear guidelines for paid holidays and sick days, including the entitlement, renewal cycle, and the procedure for requesting and obtaining leave.
